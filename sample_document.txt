RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Systems

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that enhances large language models by providing them with relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources.

Key Components of RAG:
1. Document Processing - Converting documents into indexable pieces
2. Vectorization - Creating numeric representations of text using embeddings
3. Vector Database - Storing and efficiently retrieving vectors based on similarity
4. Retriever - Finding the most relevant information for a given query
5. Generator - Using the retrieved information to produce high-quality responses

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduced hallucinations - The model can reference factual information
- Up-to-date knowledge - Information beyond the model's training data
- Transparency - Sources can be cited for verification
- Customization - Domain-specific knowledge can be incorporated

Common RAG Implementations:
- Basic RAG - Simple retrieval followed by generation
- Hybrid Search - Combining vector similarity with keyword matching
- Metadata Filtering - Using document metadata to narrow search scope
- Multi-step RAG - Breaking complex queries into multiple retrieval steps
- Re-ranking - Using additional models to improve relevance of retrieved results

Challenges in RAG:
- Context window limitations - Balancing retrieval quantity with model capacity
- Quality of embeddings - Different embedding models affect retrieval performance
- Relevance vs. diversity - Retrieving varied yet relevant information
- Evaluation - Measuring RAG system performance beyond standard metrics

Best Practices:
- Proper chunking strategies based on content type
- Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword search
- Metadata enrichment for better filtering
- Source attribution in responses
- Regular evaluation and tuning
