# RAG System Improvements

## Key Fixes and Enhancements

### 1. Vector Search Functionality

- Fixed the core query method in `multi_table_rag.py` to properly use LlamaIndex's vector search capabilities
- Implemented fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable information retrieval when standard vector search fails
- Added direct document lookup as a final fallback to ensure users always get relevant information
- Fixed embedding model integration for consistent vector search results

### 2. Document Retrieval Pipeline

- Enhanced the document retrieval workflow to properly retrieve and rank relevant chunks
- Improved source attribution to clearly show where information is coming from
- Added detailed logging throughout the retrieval process for better diagnostics
- Fixed response formatting to maintain consistency across different retrieval scenarios

### 3. Testing and Diagnostic Tools

- Created comprehensive `test_rag.py` script to verify RAG system functionality
- Added detailed logging to all components for easier troubleshooting
- Created diagnostic methods to check database connectivity and configuration
- Implemented document and table discovery to validate system setup

### 4. Documentation

- Created detailed README with information on system components and usage
- Added examples of how to use the diagnostic tools to troubleshoot issues
- Documented environment variables and configuration requirements
- Provided detailed explanation of test query results

## Technical Improvements

1. **Fixed Vector Storage Integration**:
   - Properly initialized vector stores with OpenAI embedding model
   - Ensured correct embedding dimensions and hybrid search configuration
   - Fixed schema alignment between LlamaIndex and PostgreSQL

2. **Improved Query Engine Configuration**:
   - Configured query engines with proper parameters for effective retrieval
   - Increased similarity_top_k for better recall when needed
   - Updated response formatting for better readability

3. **Enhanced Fallback Methods**:
   - Added direct SQL-based document retrieval as a last resort
   - Implemented multiple query strategies to maximize chance of finding relevant content
   - Added source tracking across different retrieval methods

4. **Debugging and Testing**:
   - Created comprehensive test script that verifies all aspects of the system
   - Added detailed logging to all components
   - Created log file export for offline analysis
   - Added validation of environment variables and configuration

## Future Enhancements

1. Add custom retrieval metrics to measure relevance and accuracy
2. Implement chunk reranking for better response quality
3. Add automated testing for system integrity
4. Expand the test suite to cover more document types and query patterns
